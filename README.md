Semester Project – PHAMARCY APP
1. Introduction
The Pharmacy Management Application is designed to streamline pharmacy operations, including inventory management, sales, and customer records. The application utilizes essential data structures such as Stacks, Lists, and Queues, and is backed by a MySQL database for data storage.
2. Objectives
•
Efficiently manage pharmacy inventory using data structures.
•
Provide an interface for sales management.
•
Store and retrieve data using a MySQL backend.
•
Implement basic data structure algorithms to handle inventory and sales processes.
3. System Architecture
•
Frontend: User Interface (UI) implemented using JavaFX
•
Backend: MySQL database to store and retrieve data.
•
Data Structures: Stacks, Lists, and Queues to manage data operations like adding and removing items, processing transactions, and handling customer orders.
•
Logic: Algorithm was written in Java
4. Algorithms and Data Structures
4.1 Stacks
•
Usage: Undo feature for sales transactions.
•
Algorithm: Push transaction details onto the stack on each sale, and pop the transaction when undoing.
4.2 Lists
•
Usage: Maintain a dynamic list of available medicines.
•
Algorithm: Linear search to find and update medicine stock.
4.3 Queues
•
Usage: Manage customer orders.
•
Algorithm: Enqueue new orders and dequeue them as they are processed.
4.4 Database Operations
•
Insertion Algorithm: Insert new inventory items or customer data into MySQL tables.
•
Update Algorithm: Modify existing records based on transactions.
•
Deletion Algorithm: Remove outdated or unwanted data from the database
